Functions
==========================
Here you can read an explanation of the functions implemented in Circuit library.

The Hamiltonian parameters are

.. math::
    E_{J}&=\frac{\hbar I_C}{2e} \text{  is a Josephson junction energy,}\\
    E_{C}&=\frac{e^2}{2C} \text{  is a charge energy,}\\
    E_{L}&=(\frac{\hbar}{2e})^2\frac{1}{2L} \text{  is an inductor energy,}\\
    \Phi_x &= 2\pi\frac{\Phi}{\Phi_0} = \frac{2e \Phi}{\hbar} \text{  is an external applied flux, in units of radians.}

To simplify these definitions, :math:`2e` and :math:`\hbar`` were equated to unity -
