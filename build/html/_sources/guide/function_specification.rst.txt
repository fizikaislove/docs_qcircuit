Functions
==========================
Here you can read an explanation of the functions implemented in Circuit library.

The main class object which should be created at the beginning is a Circuit class::

    Qubit = QCircuit.Circuit()

This class contains the following methods:


.. rubric:: Methods

.. autoautosummary:: circuit.Circuit
    :methods:

just to check that it works

The element classes:

.. autosummary::

   circuit.Capacitance
